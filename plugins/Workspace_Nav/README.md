Workspace Nav
=============

Give the workspace sidebar the ability to be interacted with via the keyboard. Means that the workspace now is either focused or unfocused.

Included key mappings for navigation, they're pretty much what you'd expect. As well as keymappings that mirror those of NERDTree for VIM.
