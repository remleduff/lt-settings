  "readme": "# Claire (-voyant) Files Backend\nClaire is a fuzzy file finder heavily inspired by Emacs' [ido-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings).\nIt implements a subset of the features ido-mode provides, with a few extra touches.\n\n`claire-files` is specifically the file finding backend for claire plugin development. A claire plugin for Light Table is\nbeing developed synchronously with this library, and can be found at my\n[claire repository](http://github.com/joshuafcole/claire). The plugin is expected to frequently query the library as the\nuser refines her search and to provide intelligent completion based on the results provided.\n\nClaire and its constituent parts are free as in liberty to use as you please to the greatest extent possible. The code is\nclean, concise and thoroughly documented with comments. External API should stay consistent, but internal aspects\nmay change in the future to improve clarity and reusability.\n\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/joshuafcole/claire-files/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n\n",
